# URL Shortener (Django)

A URL Shortener built with **Django**, featuring **user authentication**, **custom XOR-based encoding**, and a sleek **TailwindCSS UI** for managing shortened links.

---

## Features

### User Authentication
- Register, Login, and Logout securely.
- Each userâ€™s URLs are private â€” only visible in their dashboard.

### URL Shortening with XOR Encoding
- This project uses a **custom XOR-based encoding algorithm**.
- Each shortened URL code is generated by:
  - Taking the numeric unique ID of the URL record.
  - XORing it with a **4-character secret key string** (e.g., `"pkp2"`).
  - Converting the result into a short alphanumeric code.

This ensures short, unique, and **non-sequential** codes that are difficult to predict.

### URL Management Dashboard
Once logged in, users can:
- **Create** new short URLs.
- **View** all their shortened links in a list form.
- **Copy** the short link directly with a button click.
- **Delete** any previously created link.
- **Track** click counts for each link.

### Redirects
- Visiting `/<short_code>` will redirect users to the original long URL.
- Each redirect automatically increments the click counter.
